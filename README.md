# Programming-an-RTS
Programming an RTS by Carl Granberg. <br/>
I bought this book many years ago and never got around to working through it/understanding it. <br/>
The original code is DirectX 9, which still runs for the most part. A few minor tweeks I think.<br/>
To build original code, you'll need the SKD here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=6812 <br/>
DXD9 branch will hold original code.<br/>
I'll try and add other versions, Vulkan on Windows, maybe Vulkan/SDL or Vulkan/GLFW for portability.
