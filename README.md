I bought this book many years ago and never got around to working through it/understanding it. <br/>
The original code is 32-bit DirectX 9, which still runs for the most part. A few minor tweeks I think.<br/>
To build original code, you'll need the SKD here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=6812 <br/>
This branch holds the original code, with any tweeks required to get it working for modern compiler.<br/>
