I bought this book many years ago and never got around to working through it/understanding it. <br/>
The original code is DirectX 9, which still runs for the most part. A few minor tweeks I think.<br/>
To build original code, you'll need the SKD here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=6812 <br/>
DXD9 branch will hold original code.<br/>
This is a GLFW (wsi)/Vulkan implementation.<br/>
Build system is CMake (targeting Windows mostly, so you'll need to change it for another target), which I don't understand well, so if it compiles, yay!
